# Snake-Game-using-PyGame
A polished Snake Game built with Pygame using OOP concepts. The snake moves across the grid, grows by eating grapes, and the game features background music, sound effects, and a scoring system. Collision with walls or itself ends the game. Developed with a modular and clean coding approach.
